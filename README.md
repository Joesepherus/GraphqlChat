## GraphQL Chat 
This project is a basic web chat application built with React on frontend and Apollo express server. Styling should remind you of good old facebook.<br/><br />

Deployed at: https://cracked-facebook.herokuapp.com/

### `npm start`
Runs the apollo express server, that listens on the same port for classic graphql queries but also for subscriptions.

### `cd client && npm start`
Runs the react app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
